Want to figure out way to handle Schedule.wiki-like interaction
Maybe have a list, and separate list items so that if different clients update items, they can be more easily merged
How to mark an item as done?
How to mark time spent on an item?
How to assign a projected start time to an item?
How to allocate pomodoros to an item?
