I'm not satisfied with the programs I've looked at for Getting Things Done.

Here's what I'd like:

Various objects: lists, goals, projects, actions, outcomes, areas of responsibility, notes, entries, files, event, recurring objects, checklist

:object: optional metadata includes title, description, tags, context, parent, children, dates, etc.
:list: Has a title and an ordering on its child items.
:goal: progress toward something that can be quantitatively tracked.
:project: a structured outcome that you might like to apply a Gantt chart to.
:outcome: something to do that requires multiple concrete steps to achieve.
:areas: an unstructured "project", where unrelated tasks keep coming in and which doesn't have a specific end-goal.
:notes: a note about something
:entry: a measurement or note that something happened
:action: something specific to do
:event: some big event to plan
:recurring object: template for an object to be put on the calendar or action list
:checklist: list of things with checkboxes, e.g. things to pack before leaving on a trip

I want to have good context lists.  I want to be able to optionally manually order the items on action lists.
I want to be able to attach notes to any object.
Objects can be ordered in the sense of making the start of one dependent on another.
Several kind of recurring tasks: ones tied to specific dates, ones tied to the previous completion date, some should accumulate if previous one wasn't done
When actions show up: some should only show up on date due, others a few days before due date
Actions should also allow user to specify time and projected duration of task
Objects can be made children of other objects.
It'd be nice to have multiple people for planning things in the family.
Synchronizes between many devices.
Despite sharing task lists with family, also ensure privacy.
Possibility to archive old objects.
Be able to use for reference material, including photos and other binary files.
Integrate with email, to put email that meet certain criteria onto certain lists.
Integrate with calendar, to push and or pull objects from the calendar.

Dynamic scheduling
Time tracking
