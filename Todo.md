- [ ] Let 'mod' accept multiple references
- [ ] Main: 'stage' command
- [ ] Switch from String to Text and make sure umlauts are printed correctly
- [ ] For the CmdArgs modes, consider creating two for each command: one for standard parameter plus command-line-only parameters, and one with standard parameters plus internal-only parameters (e.g. 'id')
- [ ] Rename 'list' command to 'show'

- [ ] Reopen: add command to reopen closed and deleted items
- [ ] create a parser for convenient specification of dates
- [ ] Add/Mod: when an item is added with `--status=closed` or `--closed=DATE`, make sure both values get set in optsProcess2_add/mod
- [ ] Create my own parser for command lines to allow for ``otot add "my happy task" stage=today tag+happy``
- [ ] label references shouldn't be not turned into uuids for CommandRecord

When creating a new item from the commandline:

- [x] Options read by CmdArgs
- [x] Options are validated and processed
- [x] Options convert to CommandRecord
- [ ] CommandRecord saved to a temporary file
- [ ] CommandRecord read in from file
- [ ] Verify that CommandRecords are equal
- [x] CommandRecord converted to Command
- [x] Command saved to DB
- [ ] Command loaded from DB
- [ ] Verify that Commands are equal
- [ ] Command converted to a CommandRecord
- [ ] Verify that CommandRecords are equal
- [ ] CommandRecord converted to Options

- [x] items and properties are updated
- [ ] if anything went wrong, remove the Command entry and rebuild
- [ ] if everything went well, move the CommandRecord file to the appropriate path
